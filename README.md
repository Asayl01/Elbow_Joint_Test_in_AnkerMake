# Elbow Joint Test in AnkerMake

This task is about converting the robot arm joint design to STL format, slicing it in AnkerMake Studio, selecting the best printing material, and documenting the process.

## Steps

1. Started by downloading **[eufyMake Studio](https://www.eufymake.com/eufymake-studio?srsltid=AfmBOoriMVKhK--Y9ZWkDDQKiMGYHfV-nNkhsOkenRmGKbc6JUl27bW4)** 

2. After launching the software, the **AnkerMake M5 All Metal Hotend** with a **0.4 mm nozzle** was selected. This choice allows higher printing temperatures for stronger materials like PETG or ABS, while the 0.4 mm nozzle offers a good balance between precision and strength.
